          Emotion and empathy are examples of human qualities lacking in many human-machine 
          interactions. The goal of our work is to generate engaging dialogue grounded in a 
          user-shared image with increased emotion and empathy while minimizing socially 
          inappropriate or offensive outputs. We release the Neural Image Commenting Evaluation 
          (NICE) dataset consisting of almost two million images and their corresponding, 
          human-generated comments, as well as a set of baseline models and over 28,000 human 
          annotated samples. Instead of relying on manually labeled emotions, we also use 
          automatically generated linguistic representations as a source of weakly supervised 
          labels. Based on the annotations, we define two different task settings on the NICE 
          dataset.

          The NICE dataset consists of over 2M images, and 7M image-comment pairs (English) split
          into training, validation, and testing sets. In this section, we first describe how the 
          dataset was collected, and then present some of its unique characteristics. Our goal is
          to simulate natural comments from humans, which requires a large volume of data. Therefore, 
          we scraped 10 million image-comment pairs from licensed website. Each thread was required 
          to start with an image and contain at least one comment. We applied filters to both the images 
          and comments to remove sensitive content such as adult or pornographic content, racy and gory 
          content, non-English language, ethnic-religious content, and some sensitive content (including 
          people's name, documents invoices, bills, financial reports) or other potentially offensive or 
          contentious material (including inappropriate references to violence, crime and illegal substances).
          After filtering, the number of images of the dataset was reduced to 2,233,926 samples and the number
          of image-comment pairs was reduced to 7,304,680 samples. This filtering was performed with 
          pre-trained classifiers. Refer to Appendix A to find the details of dataset cleaning. We believe that
          this dataset presents a valuable resource for the community. Below we highlight some of the properties
          of the data.
