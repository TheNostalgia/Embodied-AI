          Emotion and empathy are examples of human qualities lacking in many human-machine 
          interactions. The goal of our work is to generate engaging dialogue grounded in a 
          user-shared image with increased emotion and empathy while minimizing socially 
          inappropriate or offensive outputs. We release the Neural Image Commenting Evaluation 
          (NICE) dataset consisting of almost two million images and their corresponding, 
          human-generated comments, as well as a set of baseline models and over 28,000 human 
          annotated samples. Instead of relying on manually labeled emotions, we also use 
          automatically generated linguistic representations as a source of weakly supervised 
          labels. Based on the annotations, we define two different task settings on the NICE 
          dataset.
